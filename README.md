# Workflow Documentation

This project demonstrates the use of modern AI tools and no-code automation platforms to create product marketing content, promotional visuals, and automated lead management workflows for a short-term rental service.

The workflow was executed in the following steps:

1. Company Definition & Branding
A fictional short-term rental company called StayEase Rentals was defined. The target audience includes business travelers, remote workers, and tourists. Brand tone, value proposition, and messaging were established to guide all content creation.
2. Prompt Engineering & Documentation
All AI interactions were carefully designed using clear and structured prompts. Each prompt was documented in a Notion-based AI Prompt Sheet, including the tool used, full prompt text, purpose, and output summary.
3. AI Content Generation
ChatGPT was used to generate professional service descriptions, feature lists, benefits, and ideal customer profiles. This content served as the foundation for marketing materials and the landing page.
4. Promotional Ad Creation
Google Flow (Nano Banana) was used to generate three static promotional ad creatives tailored for LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter/X. Each ad was designed with platform-specific visual styles and messaging.
5. Automation Workflow
[Make.com](http://make.com/) was used to build an automated lead capture workflow. When a user submits a booking interest form, their information is automatically saved to Google Sheets and a confirmation email is sent, improving response speed and customer experience.
6. Landing Page Creation
A conversion-focused landing page was created using Framer AI. The page presents the service offering, highlights features and benefits, and includes a call-to-action and contact form to capture leads.

This end-to-end workflow simulates a real-world AI-powered product marketing and automation pipeline.
